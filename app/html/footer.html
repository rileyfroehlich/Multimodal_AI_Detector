        <p class="footer-about">
            This website was designed to detect artificially generated deepfakes in audio, image, and text modalities as an academia project.
            To begin, click on the "Choose file" button and select a file. Once selected, click "Upload" 
            Please note this will begin the data preprocessing phase where we extract features to pass onto our neural network models.

            We have trained our Keras Tensorflow models on our datasets found 
            <a class="about-link" href="//github.com/rileyfroehlich/Multimodal_AI_Detector_ReadMe">here</a>. 
            Our test accuracies for the models used on this site range from 80%-95%, 
            although in practice this may be lower, especially as generative AI becomes better. 
            Please do not solely rely on our tool for the detection of deepfakes. Please note that we do 
            not store any uploaded data. For more information please reach out to the creators below.
