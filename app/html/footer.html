        <p class="footer-about">
            This website was designed to detect artificially generated deepfakes in audio, image, and text modalities. 
            To begin, click on the "Choose file" button and select a file. Once selected, click "Upload" 
            Please note this will begin the data preprocessing phase where we extract features to pass onto our neural network models. 
            <i>PLEASE BE PATIENT AND DO NOT REFRESH THE PAGE AFTER CLICKING UPLOAD.</i>

            We have trained our Keras Tensorflow models on our datasets found here. Our test accuracies range from 80%-95%, 
            although in practice this may be lower, especially as generative AI becomes better. 
            Please do not solely rely on our tool for the detection of deepfakes. For more information please reach out to the creators below.
